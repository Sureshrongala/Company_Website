          An IT consultant is an experienced individual who provides expert
          advice for a fee. Such an individual may work as an independent
          contractor, in which case he or she may be referred to as an
          independent consultant.
        </p>
        <p>
          An IT consultant may also be an employee at a company that offers
          consulting services. IT consultants typically charge clients an hourly
          rate for their services.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT consulting services are advisory services that help clients assess
          different technology strategies and, in doing so, align their
          technology strategies with their business or process strategies. These
          services support customersâ€™ IT initiatives by providing strategic,
          architectural, operational and implementation planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strategic planning includes advisory services that help clients assess
          their IT needs and formulate system implementation plans. Architecture
          planning includes advisory services that combine strategic plans and
          knowledge of emerging technologies to create the logical design of the
          system and the supporting infrastructure to meet customer
          requirements.
